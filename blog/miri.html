                            <p>My Uni-Face is Melanie Kolb. She's 23 and is originally from Wangen, but moved to
                                Weingarten due to her studying at RWU.
                                She started studying Business Administration Studies this year and is therefore in the
                                first semester.
                                Before that she already completed an apprenticeship as an industrial clerk and worked in
                                that field for a year.
                                Since she moved to Weingarten, not far away from the university, you can always see her
                                riding her bike, which became kind of a hobby to her then.
                                In her freetime she also likes to read many different books, best in her lovely home on
                                her favorite spot on the couch.
                                Another hobby of hers is cooking and especially baking. No matter if a fancy cake or
                                yummie muffins, Melli can do anything!
